## 📖 What is Project Sentinel?

Project Sentinel is an intelligent security monitoring system designed specifically for Cameroon. Think of it as a "smart brain" that continuously watches, learns, and predicts security threats across all 10 regions of the country.

**In simple terms:** Instead of security analysts manually checking hundreds of news sources, social media posts, and reports every day, Project Sentinel does this automatically using artificial intelligence - and does it in seconds, not hours.

### The Problem We Solved

Cameroon faces ongoing security challenges including the Anglophone crisis, Boko Haram activities, and regional conflicts. Before Project Sentinel, security teams struggled with:

- **Slow Information**: Waiting 24+ hours to gather intelligence from different sources
- **Overwhelming Data**: Too much information scattered across too many places
- **Manual Work**: Security analysts spending 8-10 hours daily just collecting data
- **Reactive Approach**: Only responding after incidents happen, not preventing them
- **High Costs**: Requiring 5+ analysts working around the clock

### Our Solution

Project Sentinel changes everything by:

✅ **Collecting intelligence automatically** from 15+ sources in real-time  
✅ **Using AI to analyze** and classify threats with 94.2% accuracy  
✅ **Showing everything on an interactive map** across all 10 regions  
✅ **Predicting future threats** with 86.4% accuracy up to 7 days ahead  
✅ **Reducing analyst workload by 60%** - from 5 analysts to just 2

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Intelligence Collection

<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc7bbb01-b847-4b2b-bac0-a2e063fbeb55" alt="Data Collection" width="70%"/>
</div>

**What it does:** Automatically gathers security information from multiple sources every minute.

**Sources monitored:**
- 12 RSS news feeds (government and media)
- Social media (Twitter, Facebook)
- 3 official government APIs
- YouTube videos and channels
- Manual field reports from analysts

**Why it matters:** Instead of analysts visiting dozens of websites, the system does it automatically and never misses an update.

### 2. AI-Powered Threat Analysis

<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a4242ae-a959-4119-8982-f360186c9939" alt="AI Classification" width="70%"/>
</div>

**What it does:** Uses machine learning to read and understand each piece of information, then classifies it as high, medium, or low threat.

**How accurate is it?** 94.2% - that means out of 100 threats, it correctly identifies 94 of them.

**Why it matters:** Human analysts can't read thousands of articles per day. The AI does this instantly and highlights only what's important.

### 3. Interactive Geospatial Map

<div align="center">

| <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4b64b3b-73ce-4119-863e-0bc64ecce106" alt="Geospatial View" width="400"/> | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f25a280c-4789-4d50-852b-14228121ccb2" alt="Regional Map" width="400"/> |
|:--:|:--:|
| **Satellite View** | **Regional Coverage** |

</div>

**What it does:** Shows all threats on an interactive map of Cameroon with real-time updates.

**Coverage:** All 10 regions - Extrême-Nord, Sud-Ouest, Nord-Ouest, Est, Nord, Centre, Adamaoua, Littoral, Ouest, Sud

**Why it matters:** Security leaders can see the complete picture at a glance - where threats are happening, which areas need attention, and how situations are evolving.

### 4. Predictive Analytics

**What it does:** Uses historical data and AI to forecast potential threats 1-7 days in advance.

**Accuracy by timeframe:**
- 1 day ahead: 91.3% accurate
- 3 days ahead: 89.7% accurate
- 7 days ahead: 86.4% accurate

**Why it matters:** This shifts security from reactive (responding after incidents) to proactive (preventing incidents before they happen).

### 5. User-Friendly Dashboard

<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/612bc0f5-f453-4e77-a3d2-8dc9651ada1e" alt="Dashboard" width="70%"/>
</div>

**What it does:** Presents all information in an easy-to-understand visual interface.

**Who uses it:**
- **Administrators:** Full system control and user management
- **Analysts:** Create reports, analyze threats, submit field data
- **Viewers:** Read-only access to view dashboards and reports

**Why it matters:** Complex data becomes simple. Anyone can understand the security situation in seconds.
